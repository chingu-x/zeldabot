Follow the steps in the [Voyage Guide](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/voyage/voyage.md#voyage-guide) we emailed last week to set a solid foundation for your project. The most important step to concentrate on is scheduling your Team Kickoff meeting as soon as possible.\n\n",
